1. ### What is Static Pods?
  This are special kubernetes pods managed directly by the kublet on a specific node, bypassing the Kubernetes API server, making them ideal for critical system components like control plane service (i.e. API server, controller-manager, scheular) that need to run locally on a node for bootstrapping or reliability, though they can't use standard API-driven management features.
  We define them via manifest files on the node's filesystem, and the kubelet watches this directory to start/stop/restart them, crating a "Mirror" pod in the API server for visibility, but not control.
