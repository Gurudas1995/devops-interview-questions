17. ### What is an IP class?
It is designed to organizes network sizes by categorizing addresses into five groups (A, B, C, D, E) based on thier first octet.
 - Class A: Designed for large networks (e.g., government, ISP). Range: 1.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (/8 mask)
 - Class B: Designed for medium-sized networks (e.g., universities, large corporations). Range: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 (/16 mask)
 - Class C: Designed for small businesses or home networks. Range: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 (/24 mask)
